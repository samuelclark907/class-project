            <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  
                Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>

                - Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.<br>
                - Avoid touching your face.<br>
                - Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.<br>
                - Stay home if you feel unwell.<br>
                - Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.<br>
